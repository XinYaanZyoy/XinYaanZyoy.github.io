Dear future me, in case if you feel like you're nobody and go back into your childhood decisions, let me tell you our dear past self was right that [[biology]]/[[medicine]] is not our thing. if you think doctors are getting more respect at your age, which they're at my age already!, then just read this Reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8zha26/comment/e2j3xvy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to pacify all of your self-doubts:

also, hey, nothing is stopping you from learning the fundamental biology, the kind that solved big problems of [[Consciousness]] and stuff, not only that it's a good thing that you didn't end up at a medschool, even though you love it SO MUCH, because not being there you get to explore the whole [[hierarchy of sciences]] and perhaps you might bliss in knowing those bridges unlike the medical practitioners living locally on specific islands, though they're beautiful in themselves you've to understand that you're an explorer. please, I beg you not to judge yourself and don't put yourself down every fucking second, that's disgusting, take care of yourself, and you family (which i suppose you've built by now? if not, get a life boy!).

hey, be a little romantic, don't suppress your feelings for girls, I know I do that but I think you're elder to me, and you're supposed to behave romantically at that age, stop being a freak. you're great, Parth, you've struggled so much to be what you deserve to (i hope you did!? if not, you'll soon for sure, i know.:)), just don't ever think about those stupid finite game players and never let yourself down because of them, none's helping me right now, so in the grand scheme of this universe you're no supposed to feel bad about the things your past and my future is about to do. you're always right, because you've the heart.

and hey, play video games sometimes, especially with her if there's any! go find her, boy! #dearfutureme
