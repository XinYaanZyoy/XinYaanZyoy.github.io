I watched The Razor's Edge 1984. it strongly makes feel about the kind of stuff I've been thinking ever since I started thinking, that is to live with something more than just "a big house a new car a year" as larry put it. I, as a kid, thought becoming an astronaut is the solution. but little did i know the life and especially the socio-eco-political system affects a huge part of education, which in turn the naive dreams. I don't actually know what I'm doing these days, it's just an explorer's hope that i am living on, namely that of a complete, or at least self-defining, understanding of this existence, and [[mathematical physics]], I feel, is the first step.

I know that going to grad-school will not help me in any socio-economical way. but I am one of those monkeys who just can't help but explore the islands of the human thought.

I'm still reading [[The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose]].

also, I discovered that my teeth are fucked up, especially the back side of the lower incisor ones which i can easily see through the mirror. I don't know when this happened, I've been looking into mirrors since my early teens, especially my teeth, so i feel this happened pretty recently like a year or two or so, which makes sense given the fact of my fucked up academic life. I'll go to the dentist soon.

I want to read some scifi manga. I think I'll begin with space brothers. but ofc not now!
