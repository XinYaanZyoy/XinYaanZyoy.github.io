### 15:30
it's 15th tomorrow. no amount of schedules work for me. no matter how sparse it is. I'm still on the way to prove stoke's theorem by first starting from the construction of reals from naturals. this shouldn't take long. I believe I can do it before the end of this month. which will cover real and complex analysis, topology, a bit of algebra, and perhaps some mathematical maturity with which i might get an ability to memorize complex and big system of equations by compressing their information.
