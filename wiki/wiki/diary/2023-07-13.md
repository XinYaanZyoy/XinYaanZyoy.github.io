I don't know what I'll become. all I want to do is to know the truth, understand this existence, explore the physical realm, and perhaps die. I think [[mathematical physics]] is the future for me. that's the only thing that's challenging enough to not bore my ADHD(?) brain, and kinda easy enough to not feel shame for not being able to have personal opinions. my childhood has been mentally unstable, and I plan not to suffer from the same in any respect possible. I hope working on this one, though giant in itself, would cure the stuff I am going through. yeah it's all about getting cured really! than about "becoming" something. my physical existence is something I haven't been able to enjoy so far, and i feel i won't be until i get out of here. I don't feel home. I hate these extra variables I am supposed to handle. let this morning/night log not be a negative one... so with that note, and a bit of optimism that I'd get into a masters program next year and then eventually to grad school by 2026. it's a long journey, but  I need to take it if i have to live. I can't otherwise.
