I've no idea what I'm doing. I'm playing cookie clicker! I've about 5 months left for the GS, I need to get on work asap. especially problem solving stuff. I think I'll now read [[Aluffi Chapter 0]] for a while. let's go!

I have a feeling that I'm not working properly as i thought i would. I need to immediately stop exploring, which I've tried and failed thousand times. idk how to do that, every now and then i get a curious thought and i enter the rabbit hole! I'll try my best to come up with a solution within next days. the goal, though a short-term one, is to practice problems, which I haven't done in ages/my lifetime. Prakhar has suggested some stuff, but I feel my have a different taste. but then I feel i wish to clear these entrances I should follow what the people on the other side are suggesting not my taste! and though Prakhar has a great taste himself, I feel he seems to be following this philosophy, and so the goal for next 2 days is to make sure I understand and fully believe in that philosophy so that i can follow it next few months, at least till the beginning of the november.
