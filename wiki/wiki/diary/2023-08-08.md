Enough of biology and goodreads exploratory distraction. it's time to only study mathematics for next 6 months. and then and only then will i even think of anything else. I might watch or read something outside of the syllabus but within mathematics. after a month or so I might restrict myself to the syllabus too. but let's not be too restrictive for now. with that note, I am closing this wiki, no more wiking, for at least next few weeks, and hope to continue doing that for longer, like 5-6 months.
